## Installing
Download the project and build it using Xcode. Realm Browser uses [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) to manage its external dependicies, so having CocoaPods installed on your system as well, while not necessary is preferred.

## Design Goals
The main design goals of Realm Browser are:
* Allow quick and easy access to the contents of .realm files.
* Be able to modify the contents of .realm files without needing to use code.
* Make it easier to automatically generate Realm Object source files.
